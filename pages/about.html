            <h2>Origins and history</h2>
            <p><br>Nike, originally known as Blue Ribbon Sports (BRS), was founded by University of

            <h2>Recycling</h2>
            <p><br>Nike has also been praised for its Nike Grind program, which closes the product lifecycle, 
                by groups such as Climate Counts. Since 1993, Nike has worked on its Reuse-A-Shoe program. 
                This program is Nike's longest-running program that benefits both the environment and the community 
                by collecting old athletic shoes of any type in order to process and recycle them. The material that 
                is produced is then used to help create sports surfaces such as basketball courts, running tracks, and playgrounds.</p>
